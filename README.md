## Consulting Visualizations Project - Python Business Analytics:

In this project I coordinated with a group while using Python, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, and Git/Github to create visualizations through Python while making commits through Git to Github, then we worked together in our partners base repository to create each visualization we were tasked with in our partners repositories.
